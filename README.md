# Tinyi2cMsgEq7
Interface with [Mixed Signal Intergrations](https://mix-sig.com/) [MsgEq7](https://mix-sig.com/index.php/msgeq7-seven-band-graphic-equalizer-display-filter) via i2c.
The MsgEq7 is a 7 band spectral analyser with analogue filters, peak detection, and a multiplexor.
The [AtTiny85](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/attiny85) microprocessor is used as a slave device to interface between the i2c Bus and the MsgEq7.
A Trs 3.5mm jack is used as an audio input.
